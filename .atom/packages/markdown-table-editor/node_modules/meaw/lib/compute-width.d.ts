/**
 * Computes the width of a string based on the EAW properties of the characters.
 * By default, characters with property Wide (W) or Fullwidth (F) are treated as wide (= 2)
 * and others are as narrow (= 1).
 * @param str Character string
 * @param widths An object that maps EAW properties to character widths
 * @return The computed width
 * @example
 * import { computeWidth } from "meaw";
 *
 * assert(computeWidth("A„ÅÇüç£Œ©") === 6);
 * // character width for each EAW property can be customized
 * assert(computeWidth("A„ÅÇüç£Œ©", { "A": 2 }) === 7);
