# You can place LaTeX Macros here.
# They are written as objects in YAML.
# Here are some examples to get you going:

# A zero argument macro
# This is just an alias for \theta.

# th: "{\\theta}" # Example usage: $\th$

# A one argument macro
# This one gives you "1 over something" as a fraction.

# inv: ["{\\frac{1}{#1}}",1] # Example usage: $\inv{x}$

# A two argument macro
# This one gives you a fraction with nicely typeset parentheses on either side.

# pfrac: ["{\\left(\\frac{#1}{#2}\\right)}",2] # Example usage: $\pfrac{x}{y}$

# You can use up to 9 arguments like this!
